## Universality of Human Condition

*   Chagnon on yamomamo: [source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument) The villages that I became really involved in, like Bisaasi-teri and these were just like my good friends, and even some of my relatives, and it was not like observer-observed kind of relationship. I wept at their funerals, and things like that. They played with my kids in the short time my kids were there. So it's very easy to empathize and recognize, even as an anthropologist or maybe a missionary, how similar these people are to you. They may have exotic customs, and eat grubs an inch long, but basically, when you scratch them, they bleed red and have emotions like yours.

## Machine Learning

*   Reservoir computing for predicting dynamical systems: A neural network acts as a “reservoir” that abstracts the higher-dimensional state of a dynamical system into a lower-dimensional state.
