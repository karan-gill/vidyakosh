## Universality of Human Condition

*   Chagnon on yamomamo: [source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument) The villages that I became really involved in, like Bisaasi-teri and these were just like my good friends, and even some of my relatives, and it was not like observer-observed kind of relationship. I wept at their funerals, and things like that. They played with my kids in the short time my kids were there. So it's very easy to empathize and recognize, even as an anthropologist or maybe a missionary, how similar these people are to you. They may have exotic customs, and eat grubs an inch long, but basically, when you scratch them, they bleed red and have emotions like yours.

## Cognitive Science

### Predictive Coding

*   Ref: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663408 
*   Surprisal -- What needs to be transmitted is therefore just the difference (a.k.a. the “prediction error”) between the actual current signal and the predicted one. This affords major savings on bandwidth -- this makes prediction error into a kind of proxy (Feldman & Friston 2010) for sensory information itself --  prediction error reports the “surprise” induced by a mismatch between the sensory signals encountered and those predicted. More formally – and to distinguish it from surprise in the normal, experientially loaded sense – this is known as surprisal
    *   Prediction and error-correction cycles occur concurrently throughout the hierarchy, so top-down information influences lower-level estimates, and bottom-up information influences higher-level estimates of the input signal.
*   Example -- Visual system -- Ganglion cells perform anti-Hebbian feedforward learning, in which correlated activity across units leads to inhibition rather than to activation  (see, e.g., Kohonen 1989), enables the creation of “novelty filters” that learn to become insensitive to the most highly correlated (hence most “familiar”) features of the input.
    *   When each eye is presented with a different image, These errors are then propagated up the system. To explain them away the overall interpretation must switch. This pattern repeats, yielding the distinctive alternations experienced during dichoptic viewing of inconsistent stimuli.
*   Actions -- you treat the desired (goal) state as observed and perform Bayesian inference to find the actions that get you there. This mapping between perception and action emerges also in some recent work on planning (e.g., Toussaint 2009). The idea, closely related to these approaches to simple movement control, is that in planning we imagine a future goal state as actual, then use Bayesian inference to find the set of intermediate states (which can now themselves be whole actions) that get us there. There is thus emerging a fundamentally unified set of computational models which, as Toussaint (2009, p. 29) comments, “does not distinguish between the problems of sensor processing, motor control, or planning.”
*   Information-theoretic free energy -- Free energy is the energy available to do useful work. Transposed to the cognitive/informational domain, it emerges as the difference between the way the world is represented as being, and the way it actually is. The better the fit, the lower the information-theoretic free energy (this is intuitive, since more of the system’s resources are being put to “effective work” in representing the world). Prediction error reports this information-theoretic free energy, which is mathematically constructed so as always to be greater than “surprisal” (where this names the sub-personally computed implausibility of some sensory state given a model of the world – see Tribus (1961) and sect. 4.1 in the present article). Entropy, in this information-theoretic rendition, is the long-term average of surprisal, and reducing information-theoretic free energy amounts to improving the world model so as to reduce prediction errors, hence reducing surprisal14 (since better models make better predictions). The overarching rationale (Friston 2010) is that good models help us to maintain our structure and organization, hence (over extended but finite timescales) to appear to resist increases in entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. They do so by rendering us good predictors of sensory unfoldings, hence better poised to avoid damaging exchanges with the environment
*   Schizophrenia -- Malfunctions within that complex economy (perhaps fundamentally rooted in abnormal dopaminergic functioning) yield wave upon wave of persistent and highly weighted “false errors” that then propagate all the way up the hierarchy forcing, in severe cases (via the ensuing waves of neural plasticity) extremely deep revisions in our model of the world. The improbable (telepathy, conspiracy, persecution, etc.) then becomes the least surprising, and – because perception is itself conditioned by the top-down flow of prior expectations – the cascade of misinformation reaches back down, allowing false perceptions and bizarre beliefs to solidify into a coherent and mutually supportive cycle
*   Attention fts very neatly into this emerging unified picture, as a means of variably balancing the potent interactions between top-down and bottom-up influences by factoring in their precision (degree of uncertainty). This is achieved by altering the gain (the “volume,” to use a common analogy) on the error-units accordingly. The upshot of this is to “control the relative influence of prior expectations at different levels” (Friston 2009, p. 299). In recent work, effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine are presented as one possible neural mechanism for encoding precision (see Fletcher & Frith [2009, pp. 53–54] who refer the reader to work on prediction error and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system such as Holleman & Schultz 1998; Waelti et al. 2001). Greater precision (however encoded) means less uncertainty, and is reflected in a higher gain on the relevant error units (see Friston 2005; 2010; Friston et al. 2009). Attention, if this is correct, is simply one means by which certain error-unit responses are given increased weight, hence becoming more apt to drive learning and plasticity, and to engage compensatory action.

### Brain Development

*   [Superagers](https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/more/articles/how-superagers-maintain-cognitive-performance-into-their-80s) -- refers to an older adult whose cognitive performance is the same as a younger adult. Felicia Sun et al., published in the Journal of Neuroscience, looked at the neuroanatomy of older adults, and found that key regions of the brain had higher cortical thickness among superagers, compared to adults who aged normally. To become a superager, Lisa Feldman Barrett (one of the authors of the study above) speculates that it takes both physical and mental activity, and it has to be difficult.
*   “engaging your child in conversation (versus just flooding them with exposure to words) is critical to language and brain development, ” -- [[popsci ref](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/harvard-mit-study-says-doing-1-simple-thing-is-almost-magical-for-your-childs-brain-development-success.html)] [[paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617742725)] -- “children who had experienced more conversational turns with adults exhibited greater left inferior frontal (Broca’s area) activation”

### Body and Mind

*   Gut Microbiome and Mind: exercise subtly changes the makeup of our microbiome. may play a role in enhancing athletic performance. [Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/24/734826163/elite-runners-gut-microbe-makes-mice-more-athletic-could-it-help-the-rest-of-us)

## Language

*   [Source](edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument)
    *   DENNETT:  Haha. In your book you mention that, although they have words, the idea of a word was not obvious to them, and that you had to go through some effort to get them to break their language up into their words, into nouns, verbs, and so forth.
    *   CHAGNON:  You must have read something I wrote about this, because that's exactly what happened. The biggest difficulty I faced in doing my field research is to get them to realize the notion of a word and where one ended and the next one began. They intuitively knew that, but they didn't know how to explain that to me. They'd make a statement to me that would go on for five pages, and it was because I didn't know where one part of the statement ended and the next began. And I finally trained one of them, right, got one of them to understand what I was trying to do. I wanted him to say a word as a discrete component in a more complex collection of words, and I thought this was a major breakthrough, and it was.
    *   PINKER:  That's true in non-literate peoples in general, and in children. , What intuitively seems to us like a word is actually the product of  active meta-linguistic awareness:  reflecting back on language as an entity.  Until the late Middle Ages there weren't even spaces between words in print. Language was just written as one long sequence of sounds, which literally is what it is. If you look at an oscilloscope tracing of speech there are no little breaks between one word and the other.

## Emotions

### Happiness

*   Competition mandates a general level of unhappiness
*   You can’t opt of competition unless you can let go of desire (meditation). However, you probably do actually want those things and need a balance. Otherwise, negative consequences.
    *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect
*   This is not a bad thing. Negative emotions, such as stress and dissatisfaction, drive change that makes you better

### Motivation vs Laziness

*   Man goes to extraordinary lengths to invent adrenal surgery over 11 years to cure chronic condition. If he didn’t have this condition, he’d have done what everyone else does -- BBQ, church, kids: https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/07/27/man-cures-himself-after-being-bedridden-11-years/

## Psyche & Technology

### Need for Belonging

*   Social Surrogacy Hypothesis https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/imaginary-friends/
    *   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.003
    *   Jaye Derrick and [Shira Gabriel](http://wings.buffalo.edu/psychology/people/faculty/gabriel.html) of the University of Buffalo and [Kurt Hugenberg](http://www.units.muohio.edu/psychology/people/hugenbk.html) of Miami University test what they call the “Social Surrogacy Hypothesis.”
    *   It appears that experiencing a lack of belonging actually caused people to revel in their favorite TV shows, as though the parasocial relationships with TV characters replaced the flawed relationships that had been recalled.

## Leaders, Politicians, Dictators

### Politicians Managing Reputations

*   [dead cat maneuver](https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/1143585761842933760): if you've been caught out doing something terrible, just throw a dead cat in the middle of the dining room table. People will still be angry at you, but they'll be angry at you about the dead cat, not about the thing you were trying to bury. For example: Prior to the model-bus interview, if you googled "boris johnson bus" you would learn about [Johnson's infamous "Brexit Battle Bus"](https://boingboing.net/2017/07/05/referendumb.html) which was driven around the UK in the runup to the Brexit vote. Today, the results are a mix of stories about the model bus hobby and the Brexit bus (as well as stories about whether this was a media manipulation gambit). This is such a brilliant example of political search engine optimization that it's hard to believe someone as buffoonish as Johnson would be capable of pulling it off intentionally.

### Organizational Trust

*   Face to face time, talking enough
*   Allow chats bferoe/after meetings

## Innovation & Decision Making

*   Peer pressure speeds decision making: PP can overcome barriers imposed upon a consensus by the existence of tightly connected communities with local leaders or the existence of leaders with poor cohesiveness of opinions. A moderate level of PP is also necessary to explain the rate at which innovations diffuse through a variety of social groups.

    *   Fairchildt five
    *   Dirac on quantum mechanics -- we were just messing around
    *   Groups of two
        *   Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, 
        *   Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman
    *   Patagonia+North Face: Mountain of Storms: Before they were magnates of the outdoors, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and The North Face’s co-founder Doug Tompkins, in 1968, they and three friends — now-famous rock climber Chris Jones, U.S. ski/snowboard Hall of Famer Dick Dorworth, and Mountainfilm founder Lito Tejada-Flores — set off from San Francisco to Patagonia.
    *   Hao Huang proved sensitivity conjecture -- [ref](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/) -- Hao learned problem in 2012 and solved in 2019 -- starting in 2013 he conjectured a new approach and thought about approach for 5 years -- 2018 he had a brainwave about a leveraging Cauchy interlace theorem -- finally brainwave in 2019.

## How Thoughts Evolve

*   Initially, people should do whatever they want as long as they aren't hurting other people-- that doesn't mean anything -- the world is complex
*   If you’re young and not a socialist you have no heart, if you’re old and not a convervative have no brain.

## Machine Learning

*   Reservoir computing for predicting dynamical systems: A neural network acts as a “reservoir” that abstracts the higher-dimensional state of a dynamical system into a lower-dimensional state.
