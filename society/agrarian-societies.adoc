= Organized Religion

== Thesis: Structure of Religion

Religions arose with agricultural. Specifically, agriculture allowed social groups in the thousands. These social groups need a mechanism to function. Religion is that mechanism. Therefore, all religions contains rules for treating followers and non-followers. Religions specify how followers can recognize each other. And religions specify how authority derives, and provide mythology for establishing identity.

All religions share the same structure:

* Laws that allow cohesion at scale.
* Holy Book that codifies laws.
* Charismatic founder who creates an institution that transcends him or her.
* Language to unify the flock.
* Rich symbolism to communicate precepts, recognize believers.
* Sacred buildings to create the sacred space.
* Rituals.
* Pilgrimates, which are rituals that involve great physical displacement towards a sacred space.
* Inheritance of divinity by representatives on Earth.

* Promise of life and rewards after death
* Ability to control fate through rituals and appeals to God, such as remove illness, misfortune. From https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/AtranNorenzayanBBS.pdf[here], every religion has
** Widespread counterfactual and counterintuitive beliefs in supernatural agents (gods, ghosts, goblins, etc.)
** Mastering by supernatural agents of peopleâ€™s existential anxieties (death, deception, disease, catastrophe, pain, loneliness, injustice, want, loss)
* Conforming behavior is rewarded by higher powers.
* Religious practices reveal divine truths and bring believer closer to the higher power.

Social mechanisms, from https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/AtranNorenzayanBBS.pdf[here], every religion has

* Hard-to-fake public expressions of costly material commitments to supernatural agents, that is, offering and sacrifice (offerings of goods, property, time, life)
* Ritualized, rhythmic sensory coordination of (1), (2), and (3), that is, communion (congregation, intimate fellowship, etc.)
