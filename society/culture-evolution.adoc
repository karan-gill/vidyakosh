Evolution of Society + Groups

## Thesis: How Humans Evolve

Human social evolution occurs as new modes of information exchange
between humans arise. These modes are prompted by changed in the environment,
which can be prompted by technological changed, which themselves could
be prompted by social evolution. Therefore ,information, culture,
and technology, drive each other in sequence.

* Language and modern humans: The development of language corresponds
  with development of stone axes and early hominins. The development
  of language proper corresponds with the development of anatomically
  modern humans.

* Symbolic culure and homo sapiens: Homo sapiens have a significantly
  richer symbolic culture than Neanderthals or Denisovans. This symbolic
  culture let homo sapiens form superior social groups to other hominins.

* Religion and agrarian societies: Religion let humans scale social
  groups, resulting in agragrian societies with social groups in the
  thousands.

* Printing press and nation states: The printing press meant anyone could
  access information, leading to the Industrial Revolution and nation states.

* Internet and sharded-pan-culture: The Internet makes information
  free and access instant. The Internet leads to a global "pan"
  culture. Simultaneously, the Internet allows speciaized communities
  to grow, leading to a "sharded" identity. See "What is the
  Internet?"

## Memetics

*   Genes are hardware and memes are software.
*   Memes allow lateral transfer.
*   Inheritance, inertia, drift.

## Cognitive Ability

*   Increased ability to process information leads to ability to exploit more niches.

## Social Brain Hypothesis

*   [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument)
    The only way you can live that nice happy free life is if you're
    in a small community, like 25 people, most of whom are
    children. So everything is happy and friendly. People get along
    with each other. But a village of 25 people is extremely
    vulnerable to raids from the outside, and the men will come in and
    steal the women, and send the men packing, or shoot the men and
    take the women. So they're constantly being pressured to maximize
    the size of their village. And as you increase the number of
    people in the village, you get increasing amounts of conflict. I
    mean the question I always ask in all villages, why did such and
    such a group fission away from such and such a group? They'll say,
    "We've just got so damn many people that we're on each other's
    nerves all the time, so we just split apart." But when the
    intensity of warfare is high, it would be really hazardous to
    split apart. And what I often found is, you know, the garden that
    might be 20 acres large, this is a big garden, and a fight might
    occur in the village that might be 200 people, and instead of
    picking up and moving the next valley over, they can't, because
    they're too dependent on their gardens. So they split the group
    into two parts, each locating in a different part of the
    garden. Then they begin transplanting their plantain cuttings,
    their banana cuttings, and tubers to some other location, maybe a
    day's walk away, until they get that garden developed to the point
    that it can feed them. Then they move away. But they may rejoin
    and move away again. …

## Law & Order

*   [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument) What about standing back and saying "We're avenging that death, which was caused when they avenged the previous death, and the cycle of violence keeps going on. Is there some way that we can extricate ourselves from this cycle?" 
    *   The answer to that is in an incident when the Yanomamö began being aware of Venezuelans. It was a territorial capital 200+ miles away, and some of the missionaries sent young guys to the territorial capital to learn practical nursing to come back to the village and treat snake bites, and scratches, and wounds, and things like that, and to give them malaria pills. And they taught them how to use microscopes. But one of these guys came back and he was just terribly excited when he told me that he discovered policia. I was like, "Well, what's policia?" "They will grab people and haul them off and put them in these little separate houses, if they do something wrong. And I think we need policia, because my brother killed a man from Iwahikorobateri five years ago, and I'm always worried that the Iwahikorobateri are going to come and kill me, because he's my brother." And he thought that if they had law, law would be a good thing.
*   Weak states lead to local solutions to maintain order. These self-governance solutions are an example of spontaneous order.
    *   Dacoits/bhaggis who cite weak state and injustice to take arms: “There are three mains reasons for someone becoming a baaghi – one, the village pradhan, two, the area thanedar and three, the patwari of the area. If these people deliver justice, no one need become a baaghi,” he says. The uncle-nephew duo turned bandits after a property dispute with a section of the extended family turned violent and resulted in their killing two members of the other faction “in retaliation and self defence”. [source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-wouldn-t-come-charging-on-horses-like-they-show-in-bollywood-films-former-chambal-dacoits-remember-time-spent-as-bandits/story-1V8dXgX7BR50weQbN1VorJ.html) // Other former dacoits HT spoke to – Hari Singh Parmar, Munna Singh, Bahadur Singh – all spoke of similar disputes (often within the family) or harassment (by influential or rich people in the village or the panchayat and the authorities), as the reason for becoming dacoits. “It was a rural economy. The only occupation was agriculture. There would be a lot of land-related disputes. When the dispute would get stuck in a revenue court or a civil court for a long time, people lost patience. In case of a fight, if a grievous crime took place, they would run away to the ravines,” agrees Joga. // Whatever the reason, the era of the infamous Chambal dacoits seems to have passed. “Two things have made it difficult for that kind of dacoit gangs to flourish here now ,” says Joga. “Roads have been constructed into the villages.” This has made even remote areas accessible for the police, and hiding a challenge for the bandits. “Plus, everyone has mobile phones now, so it is easier for us to get information. We have also initiated many grievance redressal mechanisms to settle disputes quickly,” he adds.
    *   Second example is the early history of SF where criminal rule alternated with mob justice that finally resulted in a stable city government that provided order but also corruption.

# Liberal democracy observations

*   Europe evolved towards liberal democracy because the geography meant that Europe was separated into different kingdoms and peoples, such that the optimization for peace was higher, leading to the Peace of Westphalia.
    *   Nation states evolve towards liberal democracy because people want freedom and better lives. As they get richer, they have the power to demand this. Elites can no longer oppose them.
    *   Examples: USA, Canada, Singapore etc
*   Democracies change with situation.
    *   Turkey first elected Erdogan who campaigned on Islam and nationalism. Then Turkey elected Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul who campaigned on justice, equality, love.
    *   USA elected Trump who campaigned for honesty in politics against a backdrop of political complexity and over-messaged and inauthentic campaigns.

# How do civilizations fall?

*   Climate
    *   Mayans
    *   Indus
*   Dictatorship lead to bad kings
    *   Romans
*   Economic system fails at managing complexity
    *   Soviet Union

# Identity and schism

*   The potential benefits of heterogeneity come from variety in production. The costs come from the inability to agree on common public goods and public policies. One testable implication is that more heterogenous societies may exhibit higher productivity in private goods production but lower taxation and lower production of public goods. The benefits in production from variety in skills are more likely to be relevant for more advanced societies. While in poor economies ethnic diversity may not be beneficial form the point of view of productivity, it may be so in rich ones. The more unwilling to share public good or resources are the different groups, the smaller the size of jurisdictions. The larger the benefits in production from variety, the larger the size. If variety in production can be achieved without sharing public goods, different groups will want to create smaller jurisdictions to take advantage of homogeneity in the enjoyment of the public good broadly defined. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4553005/alesinassrn_ethnicdiversity.pdf
*   Mass violence and catastrophes the only forces that can seriously decrease economic inequality? To judge by thousands of years of history, the answer is yes. https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html
*   Mark Moffett in The Human Swarm says that through a yet unknown process, societies ,or groups in general, develop a schism in identities, that eventually leads to the group’s bifurcation and schism.
*   Ethiopia federal structure is problematic because it is constituted along ethnic lines.  Ethiopia has a population of more than 108m and more than 90 ethnic groups. The biggest groups are the Amhara and Oromo. Together they comprise more than 65% of the population. The structure of a federation of 9 regions as ethnic boxes resulted in fierce inter-ethnic competition. This has affected the safety of citizens as well as the freedom of movement. The country does not strong enough institutions such as independent judiciary and agreed conflict resolution mechanisms, unlike the US, which has these mechanisms to manage its federal structure. Trust among regional states was never high, and has deteriorated over the last three decades. Federal government at the centre is too weak to impose its will on the regional administrations. Thus, there aren’t common political and economic national standards across the country.

## Case Studies

*   Africa: Scramble for Africa shows that borders were arbitrary. Data on civil conflicts after independence shows that partitioned ethnic groups suffered more warfare, more prolonged and more devastating civil wars. Civil conflict spreads from partitioned ethnicities to nearby ethnic regions. Ref: “The Long-Run Effects of the Scramble for Africa” Michalopoulos. [Link](http://freakonomics.com/media/Africa%20paper.pdf).
*   Botswana: 
    *   https://palladiummag.com/2019/05/09/what-botswana-can-teach-us-about-political-stability/
    *   The arrangement we see in Botswana—where the previous head of state publicly declares a successor—solves the problem of power succession. 
    *   Botswana avoided Cold War–driven instabilities by aligning with the West, but positioning itself such that the USSR had no interest in overthrowing it. 
    *   Botswana was a thorn in the side of South Africa, and useful to the USSR, by sometimes allowing the communist-aligned ANC to operate in its territory.
    *   Ian Khama resigning from the military before entering civilian politics, rather than using the position of general to install himself directly, however, is an example of the way military leaders can acquire political power without setting a precedent for coups.

    *   government bought half of the local branch of the international De Beers corporation, rather than seizing it. Seizure is disruptive and often destroys a company’s ability to produce as the best managers and engineers flee, while purchase ensures continuity and continued production.
    *   Simply looking at a picture of former president Ian Khama reveals that the most prosperous ethnicity married into the traditional royal family. The marriage of President Seretse Khama, Ian’s father, was controversial at the time, likely an act of love rather than intentional statecraft. However, it was read by the white minority as a credible commitment to ethnic peace. 
    *   The world, including its functional governments, is a lot more dynastic than we like to admit, and dynasties work a lot better at securing institutional continuity and good government than we like to think.
*   Venezuela vs China in building identity and navigating global power structures:
    *   https://palladiummag.com/2019/05/09/what-botswana-can-teach-us-about-political-stability/
    *   it’s almost inconceivable that the current regime would reform Venezuela along liberal, free-market lines, as doing so would open a strong vector for U.S. influence through NGOs and market power. This would contradict how the regime conceives of itself: as an autonomy maximizer—at least with respect to America—and a social-benefits maximizer. Venezuelan state is stuck with some form of social nationalism, if it intends to maintain autonomy vis-a-vis the U.S.
    *   Whereas China joined the economic system, allowed sweatshops, and then beat the US at its own game by using a stronger national identity to create a more hierarchical system that moves faster than democracy’s stochastic progress.
*   Kazakhstan: 
    *   Between 1.5 and 2.3 million Kazakhs starved, the consequences of which are felt to to the present. That famine killed 40% of all Kazakhs and reduced them from 60% of Kazakhstan’s population to 38%, the highest percentage of any ethnic group killed in the Soviet Union.
    *    in 1991, Nazarbayev found himself the leader of the world’s 9th largest sovereign state, rich in oil and other natural resources (the country is the world’s largest producer of uranium, all for export), and with a nationally and religiously divided population.
    *   Nazarbayev has referred to Kazakhstan’s position as a crossroads between Europe, Asia, and the Islamic world. This is the single most important idea guiding not just Kazakh government policy, but the identity of the country itself. In Nazarbayev’s words, Kazakhstan is a country “in the epicenter of the world,” and Astana is the “heart of Eurasia.” Rhetoric is view shared by most Kazakh academics and intellectuals and has been thoroughly integrated into Kazakh cultural life and education.
    *   Nazarbayev has put a great deal of effort over the last 30 years into making the country Russia’s closest friend and ally. This has not only removed his greatest geopolitical threat, but has also given his country a close alliance with one of the world’s foremost powers.
    *   Kazakhstan maintains excellent relations with the United States and cooperates on military, economic, and counterterrorism issues. Relations with China also remain excellent, with Kazakhstan also playing a prominent role in China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
    *   Kazakhstan’s “multi-vector” foreign policy, balancing strategic relationships between the world’s great powers.
    *   The move of the capital city from Almaty, in the far south of the country, to Astana, was seen by many as a move to reassert Kazakh claims to the majority-Russian north. If so, it has in large part succeeded, with Kazakhs increasingly migrating to the new capital and the regions surrounding it. The largest internal and external security threat to Kazakhstan is really solving itself. Russians now only make up about 20% of the country, while Kazakhs are a healthy majority of around 65%. This is not only thanks to Russian out-migration, but also to the high birth rate in Kazakhstan, which heavily skews towards ethnic Kazakh families. In fact, while birth rates plummet across the developed world, Kazakh birthrates have steadily risen and are now higher than they ever have been in the country’s post-Soviet history, with the rate hovering around 2.7 births per woman from 2014 onward. The reasons for this trend are not absolutely clear, but likely a traditional set of social norms along with general economic success and political stability have all helped to create conditions favorable for child rearing.
    *    deporting dozens of foreign imams and creating an Agency for Religious Affairs staffed with party apparatchiks who have the power to appoint imams and Islamic teachers. Any crackdowns on religion in the country have been portrayed as simply a battle against ‘nontraditional’ Islam and protective of domestic ‘traditional’ Islam, even if in many cases this seems to just be a cover.
    *   Though succession is still not absolutely clear, Nazarbayev appears to be preparing to reduce his role in government. He will be celebrating his 79th birthday later this year. In 2010, Nazarbayev was declared ‘Leader of the Nation.’ The lifetime role will protect him and his family from any prosecution, as well as giving him a broad range of powers until he dies—even if he decides not to run for president again in 2020. This means whoever becomes president next will be a kind of half-president, sharing power with Nazarbayev. In recent years he has also delegated more powers to the parliament, which is overwhelmingly controlled by his ruling Nur Otan party. Given all this, the most likely situation for succession appears to be that Nazarbayev picks his successor for president and oversees the transition while remaining firmly in control of the direction of the country in his role as Leader of the Nation. This could happen as early as 2020.

*   Animism
    *   Ancestor worship
    *   Anything can have a spirit
    *   Things are interconnected
*   Signs of increasing hierarchy
    *   Hereditary chiefship

## Sexual Relations

*   Divsion of labour - yanomamo - women do a lot of collecting of plants, and fish, and little tiny shrimps, and things like that. They make a lot of useful additions to the larder, but the men do most of the game hunting, and that requires a lot of endurance, and running, and not being hindered by babies. [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument)
    *   You can't really classify the Yanomamö as monogamous, polygamous, and polyandrous. Nor do I suspect you can do that with any society, or at least societies of the sort that you're interested in, like hunters and gatherers, transisting from hunting and gathering, to agriculture; or early agricultural societies like the Yanomamö. You have to look at marriage as a life history event. So when you're young and don't have a lot of kinsmen, the best game in town might be sharing a wife with your brother. So at that point your marriage is polyandrous. Then as you age, or your kinship fortunes increase—like more of your own kinsmen move to your village—then you might be able to do a wife all by yourself. And then if you become politically important and have a lot of relatives and lots of sisters to give away in marriage, you might end up with two or three wives. The most wives a Yanomamö I know has ever had is six at the same time.
    *   They formally acknowledge marriage.
    *   Big villages lord over small villages. So if you're seeking an ally who will protect you from the people up the hill who are bigger than you, you're at a disadvantage because in order to get allies, you've got to give women to them. It's an economics game where the smaller village has to pay up front for the privileges of the alliance, and the bigger village tends to default on many of its agreements. So big villages tend to exploit small villages. It's always a good idea to live in a big village; however, it's like living in a powder keg.

## Violence

*   The further back in time you go, the more that unpleasant things are ubiquitous in your environment. Violence is just around the corner, and wishing for a return to the noble savage past is possibly one of the biggest errors. Pueblo houses built into the edge of the Grand Canyon, with a 1,000-foot drop below, and these houses were occupied by prehistoric Indians who were so terrified of their neighbors that they'd climb down vines and ropes with their kids on their back, and firewood under their arm, and the day's catch in their baskets, because they were just terrified of their neighbors. And that's the way the Yanomamö live. Even the missionaries who have lived among the Yanomamö the longest have pointed out repeatedly to me and other people that these people are terrified of neighbors. [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument)

## Causes

*   one of the things they fight over is women [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument)
*   Yanomamö fight over honor. They have grudges against each other. They don't like to fight. They prefer to be friendly, amicable, and live life in harmony. But they're caught in a conundrum of the following sort. The only way you can live that nice happy free life is if you're in a small community, like 25 people, most of whom are children. So everything is happy and friendly. People get along with each other. But a village of 25 people is extremely vulnerable to raids from the outside, and the men will come in and steal the women, and send the men packing, or shoot the men and take the women. So they're constantly being pressured to maximize the size of their village. And as you increase the number of people in the village, you get increasing amounts of conflict. When the villages are attacking each other, it's almost always for revenge. Blood is their argument. The Yanomamö will always attempt to avenge the death of a kinsman. It may take them a long time, and when the tables are turned on the guys that did it, like they get too small as a group, then it may appear to be a preemptive strike, but it has some historical roots. It's almost never a case where they attack another Yanomamö village preemptively for no reason at all. It's usually a consequence of some previous argument. And they'll rejoice and say, "I spattered his blood all over his wife, and his kids, and even his dog."

## Infanticide

*   [Source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/napoleon-chagnon-blood-is-their-argument) Infanticide: the Yanomamö practice infanticide occasionally, and it's for a variety of reasons. One of them being if they suspect that the newborn infant is deformed, and it can be traced right back to parental investment. Why invest in a losing prospect? Let's terminate the infant now and start anew. Another example of infanticide is, this is even rarer, that some guy was cuckolded by, or suspected he was cuckolded by some other guy, and he puts pressure on his wife to kill the new infant. That's not very common, but I've heard of it.

# Organized Religion

## Thesis: Structure of Religion

Religions arose with agricultural. Specifically, agriculture allowed
social groups in the thousands. These social groups need a mechanism
to function. Religion is that mechanism. Therefore, all religions
contains rules for treating followers and non-followers. Religions
specify how followers can recognize each other. And religions specify
how authority derives, and provide mythology for establishing
identity.

All religions share the same structure:

* Laws that allow cohesion at scale.
* Holy Book that codifies laws.
* Charismatic founder who creates an institution that transcends him or her.
* Language to unify the flock.
* Rich symbolism to communicate precepts, recognize believers.
* Sacred buildings to create the sacred space.
* Rituals.
* Pilgrimates, which are rituals that involve great physical displacement towards a sacred space.
* Inheritance of divinity by representatives on Earth.

## Cause

*   agriculture generally developed around 3000 bc ex Mayans. Was it general stable Holocene climatic factors?
*   Agriculture gave rise to complex societies that needed organizing structure.

## Religious Mechanisms

Psychological mechanisms by which religions exercise control [source](https://ffrf.org/outreach/awards/emperor-has-no-clothes-award/item/20327-steven-pinker):

*  Promise of life and rewards after death
*  Ability to control fate through rituals and appeals to God, such as remove illness, misfortune.
*  Conforming behavior is rewarded by higher powers.
*  Religious practices reveal divine truths and bring believer closer to the higher power.

# Nation States

## Thesis: Why Nation States Replaced Religion

Religion cannot change. Religious laws are codified in books and enforced absolutely. However, the printing press and subsequent mercantilism lead to rapidly changing conditions. Trade requires tariffs, regulations, security and so on. Given religion cannot adapt, non-religious authority emerges. Eventually, society must relegate religion and codify rules as is, without the need for divine authority. Removing divine authority means rules can change.

For further context on nation states, you'll find it useful to read the reasons that created the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia).

    *   Eating meat let us extract more energy around 2.3 MYA.
    *   Stone tools meant we could process raw food without massive teeth.
