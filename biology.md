## Genetic Evolutionary Mechanisms

*   Genetic drift
*   Natural selection
*   Lateral transfer of genes
*   Symbiosis


## Symbiotic relationships

*   Heterokaryon -- one example is slime molds. This happens because the nuclei in the 'plasmodium' form are the products of many pairwise fusions between [amoeboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeboid) [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploid) individuals. When genetically divergent nuclei come together in the plasmodium form, cheaters have been shown to emerge. However, genetic homogeneity among fusing amoeboid serves to maintain the multicellular plasmodium.


## Systems Biology

### Control Theory

*   [Source](https://www.quantamagazine.org/math-reveals-the-secrets-of-cells-feedback-circuitry-20190918/) - [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.01.004) - two controller molecules must have a very specific relationship: They have to bind to each other and neutralize each other’s biological activity. One must be the antithesis of the other. In this negative feedback loop, an activator molecule would stimulate production of a desired protein. In turn, that protein’s concentration would determine the rate of production for an anti-activator molecule, one that sequestered the activator. If something perturbed the system, any error in protein levels would be corrected through a corresponding change in the rate of anti-activator production. Best of all, because the activator and anti-activator molecules would seek out and neutralize each other, this loop would work even in a noisy cell.


### Heuristics

*   Immune system balance point: While an overactive immune system is better at fending off parasites, it may also lead to higher risk of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. [[ref](https://voices.uchicago.edu/dfiwellnews/2018/09/12/evolution-of-the-human-immune-response/)]
