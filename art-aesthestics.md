## Aesthetics and Superstimulus

Tinbergen's concept of superstimulus.

 -- The same person can be fat, not groom themselves or conform to the standard of attractiveness. Thus, does aesthetics convey how hard-working/motivated/driven a person is and how seriously they take themselves?

Thoughts on status on society:

 - Anything that is difficult to obtain can be a status symbol.

 - Therefore being thin in an era of abundant sugary food is a status symbol. Expensive things are.

 - Status symbols also convey affiliation to a certain group. Such as plaid and oversized thick rimmed glasses for hipsters. These convey status by way of that affiliation.

 - In itself, oversized thick rimmed glasses have no utility. This is what I mean by "anything can be a status symbol". All it requires is it becomes a trend and is 'adopted'. It begins to symbolize something.

 - These symbols tie in with aesthetics because they evoke some sort of stimulus in the brain.

 - However, aside from pure aesthetic value, they are also have cultural/social/status value.

 - Why do we have status? To make decisions in society. Someone has to be selected -- status is the process of setting hierarchy so that decisions can be made in society.

Culture

 - Celebrity-ship is random. Eg. Paris Hilton.

 - Van Gogh. Famous only after death. Example of artist that is rehabilitated. Culture and art go in waves, each succeeding wave drawing from and opposing the previous wave to distinguish itself.

 - Perhaps what is fashionable is culture.

 - But, Art that endures is aesthetic art. It, apart from any cultural value, has aesthetic value from the way it hacks our brain circuits, and thus endures, and become classic.

 - Banksy’s self destruction art: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-08/banksy-s-genius-lies-not-in-art-but-in-economic-experimentation

If Banksy were an economist rather than a satirical street artist with clearly leftist views, he might have wrapped his findings into a model — perhaps like the one described in Moshe Adler’s purely theoretical 1985 [paper](http://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/research/papers/others/1985/adler1985a.pdf) that sought to explain “why a hierarchy in income could exist without a hierarchy in talent.” Adler wrote:

The main argument was that the phenomenon of stardom exists where consumption requires knowledge. The acquisition of knowledge by a consumer involves discussion with other consumers, and a discussion is easier if all participants share common prior knowledge. If there are stars, that is, artists that everybody is familiar with, a consumer would be better off patronizing these stars even if their art is not superior to that of others.
