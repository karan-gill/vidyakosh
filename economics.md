## Monetary System

### Principles

*   Money is the universal commodity. Fiat.
*   Money sloshes around economy is search of returns.
*   Amount of money determined by monetary system. More = volatility.
*   System must absorb money just as power grid absorbs electricity.
*   Ex: If money floods system, everything is more expensive, people are poorer, unclear if money is spread equally, unclear if people can afford expensive goods, eventually goods don’t sell and default. A series of debts are owed. To unwind debts, govt steps in.
*   Therefore, banks + reserve + govt steward monetary system.
*   If central banks print money,
    *   Then that creates the illusion of wealth.
    *   However, inflation increases, asset prices increases etc hence the illusion.
    *   To keep the illusion, central banks must keep printing -> runaway.
    *   Instead, productivity must rise for actual progress.
    *   However, printing money helps get monetary system going away; otherwise, people are too afraid to lend.

### Money Needs Institutional Backing

    *   Facebook’s proposed currency is a chance to finally deploy the arguments that people who hate central banks deploy against you all the time.
    *   money needs state sovereignty to be “credible and durable” -- which raises the question of what kind of state we’re talking about.
    *   Conglomerates of corporate entities, he adds, “are only accountable to their shareholders and members”. Such conglomerates “can hardly be seen as repositories of public trust or legitimate issuers of instruments with the attributes of “money”.


### Money suppy + interest rates

*   LIBOR fixing scandal -- 
    *   banks were falsely inflating or deflating their rates so as to profit from trades, or to give the impression that they were more creditworthy than they were
    *   public and private financial institutions manipulating interest rates to prop up the prices of bonds and other fixed income instruments, and that "the motives of the Fed, Bank of England, US and UK banks are aligned, their policies mutually reinforcing and beneficial. The Libor fixing is another indication of this collusion." [[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20130805221036/http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/07/14/the-real-libor-scandal/)]


### Bubbles

*   People borrow on expectation of returns.
*   If returns don’t materialize, you get default and bubble.
*   Central banks can print to inflate away debt and absorb bubble but that causes inflation.
*   A sector can be out of sync, such as housing or tech, because of sector-specific expectations of high returns.
*   Therefore, bubbles result from society processing information to arrive at incorrect predictions of the future. Recessions reconcile incorrect predictions with reality.


### Steady state

*   As productivity increases, the same amount of money buys more.
*   Hence, real increase in wealth without resort to money printing.


## xComplexity

### Monetary Policy

*   The more complex the system, the harder for agents to predict the future, and for agents to see the gap between prediction and reality. Hence, complexity obfuscates the true nature of problems, leading to bubbles going unnoticed.
*   Further, central banks or politicians might incorrectly diagnose bubbles as fundamental problems and try to monetize debt, or print money to stimulate the economy.


### Internationalization

*   International money flows add noise
*   High savings countries chase returns
*   Global rich
*   Capital controls
*   Hawala

## Case Study: Great Recession 2008
*   A financialised economy will have a thriving banking system, but it will also be characterised by rising household and corporate debt, soaring asset prices, huge capital inflows, deindustrialisation and growing income, wealth and regional inequality.
*   In the US and the UK, the deregulation of commercial banking and the removal of restrictions on capital mobility led to a lending boom in the 1980s. Banks faced far fewer restrictions on their ability to create money by extending credit, and mortgage lending in particular soared. 
*   As the money directed into property markets increased faster than the housing stock, property prices boomed. Rising house prices allowed consumers to borrow even more by releasing the equity from their homes.
*   Capital from all over the world flowed into British and American property and financial markets, pushing up the value of the currency and harming exporters. As tax revenues from the sector flowed into Treasury coffers, the state’s willingness to regulate it waned. 
*   Economists failed to pay attention to any of these indicators before the crash, instead dubbing the period between 1989 and 2007 the “great moderation” — a time of high growth, low inflation and generalised economic and financial stability. Only when the boom finally ended did they realise the veneer of moderation had concealed a wellspring of excess.
*   But the financial crisis did not spell the end of financialisation — instead, it heralded another phase of its expansion. Since the financial crisis, property prices in Sydney and Melbourne have risen 105 per cent and 94 per cent respectively. Private debt-to-GDP, which includes all household and corporate debt, has increased from 184 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 205 per cent today. Household debt is more than 200 per cent of average incomes, making Australian households some of the most indebted in the world.
