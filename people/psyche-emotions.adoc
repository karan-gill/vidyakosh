## Emotions

### Happiness

*   Competition mandates a general level of unhappiness
*   You can’t opt of competition unless you can let go of desire (meditation). However, you probably do actually want those things and need a balance. Otherwise, negative consequences.

    *   Jaye Derrick and [Shira Gabriel](http://wings.buffalo.edu/psychology/people/faculty/gabriel.html) of the University of Buffalo and [Kurt Hugenberg](http://www.units.muohio.edu/psychology/people/hugenbk.html) of Miami University test what they call the “Social Surrogacy Hypothesis.”
    *   It appears that experiencing a lack of belonging actually caused people to revel in their favorite TV shows, as though the parasocial relationships with TV characters replaced the flawed relationships that had been recalled.


## How Thoughts Evolve

*   Initially, people should do whatever they want as long as they aren't hurting other people-- that doesn't mean anything -- the world is complex
*   If you’re young and not a socialist you have no heart, if you’re old and not a convervative have no brain.
