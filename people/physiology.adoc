== Sleep

* Purpose: As you sleep, slow waves of electrical activity in your brain seem to help rinse away harmful waste products that could otherwise damage your brain cells. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2222016-a-type-of-brainwave-may-help-clean-your-brain-while-you-sleep/#ixzz64nywwGGF[Ref].

=== Gut and Physiology

* Gut Microbiome and Body: exercise subtly changes the makeup of our microbiome. may play a role in enhancing athletic performance. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/24/734826163/elite-runners-gut-microbe-makes-mice-more-athletic-could-it-help-the-rest-of-us[Source]

== Food, Energy, Metabolism

* Cooking made food easier to digest and let us extract more calories per gram. https://www.npr.org/2010/08/02/128849908/food-for-thought-meat-based-diet-made-us-smarter[source]
** Eating meat let us extract more energy around 2.3 MYA.
** Stone tools meant we could process raw food without massive teeth.
** Cooking makes digestion much, much easier ~2 MYA.
** Cooking let us evolve from chimps to humans. Develop a smaller, more efficient digestive tract which freed up energy to enable larger brain growth. Humans cannot maintain reproductive fitness with raw food. [Richard Wrangham - Catching Fire]

== Lifespan

Grandmother hypothesis: Grandmothers help * care for young. See Schultz’s graph on primate life:

* (unproved) Grandparents are essential for social stability – respect elders because elders see social situations evolve and have perspective.

== Physiology

* Humams are made to run and hunt prey via persistence hunting.
* Human skeletons are changing due to the different stresses of modern life: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190610-how-modern-life-is-transforming-the-human-skeleton
